# 🧠 SafeBox: Intelligent Resource Management & Deadlock Prevention System

> 🔒 **SafeBox** is a next-generation sandboxing system designed for secure process isolation, intelligent resource management, and proactive deadlock prevention using the **Banker’s Algorithm**.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

* ✨ **Secure Process Isolation** — Uses Linux **namespaces**, **cgroups**, and **seccomp filters** for robust sandboxing
* ⚙️ **Smart Resource Management** — Dynamically allocates and monitors CPU, memory, and I/O resources
* 🧮 **Deadlock Prevention** — Implements the proven **Banker’s Algorithm** for safe resource allocation
* 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring** — Interactive **CLI tools** and an optional **Flask-based dashboard**
* 🎓 **Built for Learning** — Ideal for **Operating Systems** coursework and academic research
